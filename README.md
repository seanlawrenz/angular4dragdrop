# Drag and Drop demo

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.3.1.

Demo of drag and drop options for the card wall conversion.

In the first area, notice that I can restrict the movement of the boxes after they have been dropped. 

In the second, notice that you can't fit a square peg in a round hole.
